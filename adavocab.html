    <h2>Inert Perfection</h2>

 
    by <a href='https://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/23304'>Edna St. Vincent Millay</a>

    Inert Perfection, let me chip your shell.
    You cannot break it through with that soft beak.
    What if you broke it never, and it befell
    You should not issue thence, should never speak?‚Äù
    
    Perfection in the egg, a fluid thing,
    Grows solid in due course, and there exists;
    Knowing no urge to struggle forth and sing;
    Complete, though shell-bound. But the mind insists

    It shall be hatched ... to this ulterior end:
    That it be bound by <b>Function</b>, that it be
    Less than Perfection, having to expend
    Some force on a nostalgia to be free.

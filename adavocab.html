    <h2>Inert Perfection</h2>
    by <a href='https://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/23304'>Edna St. Vincent Millay</a>
<p><p>
    Inert Perfection, let me chip your shell.<br>
    You cannot break it through with that soft beak.<br>
    What if you broke it never, and it befell<br>
    You should not issue thence, should never speak?<br>
   <p> 
    Perfection in the egg, a fluid thing,<br>
    Grows solid in due course, and there exists;<br>
    Knowing no urge to struggle forth and sing;<br>
    Complete, though shell-bound. But the mind insists<br>
<p>
    It shall be hatched ... to this ulterior end:<br>
    That it be bound by Function, that it be<br>
    Less than Perfection, having to expend<br>
    Some force on a nostalgia to be free.<br>
